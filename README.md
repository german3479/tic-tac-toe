# TIC-TAC-TOE
---

## About Me
I am Steven Edwards, seeking to improve my webdev skills, including learning to make at least simple games such as this.

## Description
Idea taken from TOP ([The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe))

## Changes from TOP Guideline
- I've decided to hard-code the Tic-Tac-Toe grid as opposed to using a Gameboard object. I figure since we'll be seeing the board all the time, it's more logical to build out the individual cells as we know in advance a traditional game only has a 3x3, or 9-cell setup.

## Current Issues
A **LOT**. This is an early draft, uploaded to Github. 

## Future Ideas
- Build out an AI, starting with a basic one, then staggering it out in stages (beginner, intermediate, advanced). 

- I plan to make it possible to have 2 AIs duke it out, hence the AI checkboxes next to each player upon game setup.
